# GitHub Pages

### What are GitHub Pages?

[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) 

> Websites for you and your projects.

These are hosted directly from your [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/). The page(s) can be edited, created, and done as what you wish with them.

### Why?

Currently, I am just using the Pages as a way to test a few things with [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). I am also going to try to edit this more or less with [Typora](https://typora.io/), which is an editor for Markdown.

### Who am I?

I am Eye_Of_Wither, a player on the [Hypixel Network](https://hypixel.net). As of right now, this is just a simple testing bit for me, and might be a way for me to mess around with a few things in the future. 



Who knows, I might even add a little [Python](https://www.python.org/) program on my [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/wither-code/wither-code) in the future, but for now it will probably remain empty.
